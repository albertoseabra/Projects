#### https://github.com/albertoseabra/Projects/blob/master/exploration/adults_analysis.ipynb
EDA of a data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) with census data of the USA. Includes information like age, 
ocupation, education, hours worked. The target is if the person makes more or less than 50k.

EDA of a dataset of the number of bike rentals with information like date and time, weather, temperature, workday.

#### https://github.com/albertoseabra/Projects/blob/master/exploration/flights.ipynb
EDA and Feature engineering of a dataset of the flights in the USA during the year of 2015. The objective is to analyse what influences
the delays of the flights. Plenty of variables available.
Final objective is to predict if a flight will arrive delayed or not, predictions in this file:

## Text Summarizer
### New Version: https://github.com/albertoseabra/Projects/blob/master/summarizer/summarizerembeddings.py
New version with using word embeddings instead of TF-IDF vectors   
Can make summaries also with different methods:
+ Implementing Textrank but now first the sentences are transformed using word embeddings and then is calculated the similarity between them
+ A summarizer that just selects the sentences that are most similar with the full text, ends up givin the same results as Textrank
+ A greedy algorith that adds to the summary the sentence that gives the largest increase in similarity between the full text and the summary, avoiding that way the problem of adding redundant sentences, sentences that are similar to the full text but don't increase the ammount of information in the summary

#### 1st version now with OOP https://github.com/albertoseabra/Projects/blob/master/summarizer/summaryOOP.py

Extracts a summary of a text. Using two different methods:  
  - Selecting most important sentences based on tf-idf    
  - Creating a graph, calculating similarity between sentences and applying PageRank to select the most important sentences   
Also extracts the most important words from a text, works with a url or with the text of the news, and can do the summary with sentences or paragraphs.
