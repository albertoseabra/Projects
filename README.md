## Text Summarizer
#### Now with OOP https://github.com/albertoseabra/Projects/blob/master/summarizer/summaryOOP.py
##### https://github.com/albertoseabra/Projects/tree/master/summarizer
Extracts a summary of a text. Using two different methods:  
  -Selecting most important sentences based on tf-idf    
  -Creating a graph, calculating similarity and applying PageRank    
Also extracts the most important words from a text
