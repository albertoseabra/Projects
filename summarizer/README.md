## Summarizer of text news

Needs a corpus to build the tf-idf vector
Will make a summary of the text you want in the number of sentences you want.
Two different ways of summarizing:
    1 - Calculates the more important sentences based on tf-idf of the words and extract those sentences
    2 - Calculates the similarity between sentences and creates a graph, extracts the most important sentences after applying PageRank
